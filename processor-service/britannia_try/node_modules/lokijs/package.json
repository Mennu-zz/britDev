While the roadmap is exciting, LokiJS is at the moment stable.\nAs LokiJS is written in Javascript it can be run on any environment supporting javascript such as browsers, node.js/node-webkit, hybrid mobile apps (such as phonegap/cordova), or the jvm through engines such as rhino.\n\nMade by [@techfort](http://twitter.com/tech_fort), with the precious help of Dave Easterday. [Leave a tip](https://gratipay.com/techfort/) or give us a star if you find LokiJS useful!\n\n### Main Features\n\n1. Fast performance NoSQL in-memory database, collections with binary-index\n2. Runs in multiple environments (browser, node)\n3. Dynamic Views for fast access of data subsets\n4. Built-in persistence adapters, and the ability to support user-defined ones\n5. Changes API\n\n## Installation\n\nFor browser environments you simply need the lokijs.js file contained in src/\n\nYou can use bower to install lokijs with `bower install lokijs`\n\nFor node environments you can install through `npm install lokijs`.\n\n## Demo\n\nThere's a node-webkit small demo in the folder demos/desktop_app. You can launch it by running `/path/to/nw demos/desktop_app/'\n\n## Roadmap\n\n* key-value datastore\n* MRU cache\n* MongoDB API compatibility\n* server standalone (tcp and http servers and clients)\n* replication and horizontal scaling\n\n## Contact\n\nFor help / enquiries contact joe.minichino@gmail.com\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2015, Joe Minichino <joe.minichino@gmail.com>\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.
